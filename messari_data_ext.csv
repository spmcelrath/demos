While blockchains are the most commonly used DLTs, Hedera is slightly different since it uses a new consensus algorithm known as hashgraph. The hashgraph consensus algorithm aims to process and finalize more transactions at scale than traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks, as they are often characterized by high latency and low transactions per second (tps). Hedera's state is stored on mainnet nodes, which are all currently run by members of the Hedera Governing Council. But in the future, mainnet nodes will be permissionless. These nodes secure the Hedera ledger by reaching a consensus on the validity and order of transactions.

Hedera provides two core network services: the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) and the Hedera Token Service (HTS). HCS allows clients to submit messages to the Hedera network for consensus timestamping and ordering, but it doesn't require the consensus nodes to store state related to that message. Instead, application state or data is persisted off-chain, where HCS users can define confidentiality and access control that cater to their use-case. The HTS supports native tokenization, whereby clients can create and manage various token types.

It aims to address the scalability issues present in existing blockchains where the cost to verify the blockchain grows proportionally with total transaction throughput. In these cases, the cost of running a network node eventually exceeds the resources available to most real-world users.

The goal of Mina is to design a decentralized payment system that offers efficient verification of system history from genesis without relying on any external advice. This is achieved by the following properties:
A formal notion of a “succinct blockchain”
Generic functionalities modeled as replicated state machines using incrementally computable SNARKs
Concrete implementation of a payments system called Mina
Ouroboros Samasika, a provably-secure PoS consensus protocol that is adaptively secure and offers bootstrapping from genesis.
Parallel scan state to improve transaction confirmation time beyond the limits otherwise imposed by the proof construction.
Performance evaluation report of executing the protocol involving a public community.",MINA

Its network uses a scaling technique called sharding that partitions storage and processing responsibilities to smaller validator groups. The result is a chain that has lower transaction latency and higher throughput compared to blockchains operating as a single state layer. Free TON uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to achieve consensus and can support application development in several high-level computer languages such as C, C++, and Solidity. Network participants can use TON Crystals to pay for transaction fees or stake to secure the network and vote on governance proposals.",TON
